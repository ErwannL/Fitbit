# Fitbit Data Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
This report analyzes Fitbit activity data as part of the "Het Nieuwe Gezonde Werken" (HNGW) initiative at Hanze University of Applied Sciences Groningen (HUAS). The analysis aims to predict whether individuals will reach their daily step goals, enabling automated coaching processes to promote physical activity in the workplace.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
Physical inactivity is a major global health concern:
